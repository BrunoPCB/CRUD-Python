This project will have two stages:

- Stage 1

- - Create a CRUD using the knowledge I currently have.

- Stage 2

- - Recreate the same CRUD, but following a software development paradigmâ€”specifically, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Note: I may consider using a different paradigm instead of OOP.
